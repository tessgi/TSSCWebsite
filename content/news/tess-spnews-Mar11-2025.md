Welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin.

In every TESS Cycle specific targets will automatically receive 2-min cadence observations.

Cycle 8 proposals are due in just over two weeks, **March 27th**, as such we are providing the [pre-selected target list](data/Cycle8_visibility.csv) for reference.

Proposals utilizing these targets are still encouraged, and may be submitted and selected for funding.

Proposers may also ask to observe these objects with the higher 20-second cadence, and include them in their overall science goals.

Happy writing.

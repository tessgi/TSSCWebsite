Welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin.

In every TESS Cycle specific targets will automatically receive 2-min cadence observations.
With Cycle 8 proposals due in just over two weeks, **March 27th**, we have decided to provide this [target list](/data/Cycle8_visibility.csv) in advance.

Proposers can still ask to observe these objects with the higher 20-second cadence observations, and include them in their overall science goals.

Proposals utilizing only targets from this list may still be submitted and selected for funding"
Happy writing.

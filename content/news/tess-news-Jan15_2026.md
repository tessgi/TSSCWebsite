Over the summer, we announced that 22 proposals requesting funding via TESS Cycle 8 were being held in a “selectable” state, pending clarification of budget and programmatic priorities. This week, we are inviting 14 of the 22 proposals to submit Phase 2 budget proposals to NASA. Eight proposals will continue to be held in a "selectable" state pending clarification of budget and programmatic priorities. The PIs of these proposals have been directly notified via email.

We will update this webpage after a final determination has been made. Please see our previous news bulletin for more statistics about [Cycle 8](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-cycle-8-gi-target-allocation-complete.html).

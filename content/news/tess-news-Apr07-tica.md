The [TESScut](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/) service at MAST generates cutouts of TESS full-frame images (FFI) time series for a region of the sky. Until now, users could select whether to generate cutouts using SPOC or TICA products. The SPOC products are the official mission FFIs, and the TICA products are a quick-look alternative while SPOC products are still being processed.
 
For FFIs from Sector 91 and beyond, the TESScut service will only be available for SPOC products. TICA FFIs will still be generated and archived at MAST.

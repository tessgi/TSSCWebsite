The TESS Cycle 8 review was held earlier this year, and preliminary decisions have been sent out.  133 proposals were submitted, covering a wide variety of science cases including exoplanets (42), stellar astrophysics (75), extragalactic sources (10), solar system science (1) and other science including data processing techniques (5). The proposals were reviewed and assessed by a panel comprised of experts in the respective fields.

A total of 12 proposals requesting observations but no funding were selected, while 22 proposals requesting funding were highly ranked and placed in the selectable range. At this time, the final decision to fund these proposals is pending clarification of budget and programmatic priorities.  However, any 2-minute cadence or 20-second cadence targets requested as part of the selectable proposals are prioritized for observation in Cycle 8.

We appreciate the robust response and all of the great science proposed for by the community, and are excited for the official start of EM3 observations later this month!

    <p>While TESS was origninally designed to find exoplanets, the required stable, high-cadence images that cover the entire sky have applications to many other fields of astronomy. Currently ~60% of publications using TESS data come from fields outside of exoplanet science, including stars, supernovae, and solar system objects. </p>
    <p>The plot below shows the number of peer-reviewed journal articles utilizing TESS data over time. The TESS papers are further broken up into papers related to exoplanets or astrophysics, which in this context is all applications outside of exoplanets. While initially exoplanets and other science were roughly equally represented, the trend indicates that TESS is being increasingly used for purposes outside of the primary mission goal.</p>

States containing institutions heavily involved with the development and operation of TESS (California, Massachusetts, and Maryland) show a strong concentration of authors. However, TESS has reached authors at nearly every state.

## Career Stage of TESS GIs
TESS GI funding awards ~$3M a year to support science conducted with TESS data. The Principal Investigators (PIs) of successful proposals have a broad range of experience. As shown in the pie chart below, for TESS Cycles 1-6, 63% of PIs are early career scientists, meaning within 10 years of receiving their PhD. Impressively, nearly 10% of successful PIs are still students. The career stage is further broken down in the histogram on the right.

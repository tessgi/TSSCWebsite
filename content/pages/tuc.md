Title: TESS Users Committee
template: slide
save_as: tuc.html

The TESS Users Committee (TUC) is a group of ten members from relevant science communities and external to the TESS project. The goal of the TUC is to provide input to the project on behalf of the user community in order to boost the impact of TESS within the scientific community over the missionâ€™s lifetime. The TUC is also designed to assist the TESS Project Scientist in preparation for Senior Reviews of the mission during its operational phase.

Key areas that the TUC is anticipated to examine include: data processing pipelines, data products, data access, data analysis tools, documentation, General Investigator (GI) program policies and implementation, and observing strategies to optimize science return.

The [TUC Charter](data/TUC/TESS_Users_Committee_Charter_2023Aug15.pdf) describes in more detail the goals and structure of the TUC. Please contact the TUC chair or any member for more information or to submit an idea or topic for a future TUC meeting. TUC meeting dates and agendas will be made publicly available on this website.

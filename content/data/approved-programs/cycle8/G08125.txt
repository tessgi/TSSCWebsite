Title: TESS 20-Second Cadence Data For Transiting Planet Hosts And Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets

PI: Huber, Daniel - University Of Hawaii (Manoa)

Type: SMALL

Summary: An key innovation of the TESS extended missions was the introduction of 20-second data, which shows strongly improved photometric precision per unit time compared to 2-minute data for bright stars due to differences in cosmic ray rejection algorithms. We propose to obtain 20-second data for all bright TESS Objects of Interest and all high-priority Habitable Worlds Observatory targets observable in Cycle 8. Our program will yield improved radii and orbital eccentricities for several key transiting exoplanet systems, including planets slated for atmospheric studies with JWST, and detect variability due to rotation, granulation and flares in NASA's highest priority direct imaging targets in the coming decades.

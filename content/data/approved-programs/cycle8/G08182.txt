Title: Tracing The Evolution Of Planetary Systems In Binaries With TESS Gyrochronology

PI: Kraus, Adam - University Of Texas At Austin

Type: SMALL

Summary: Half of Sun-like stars form with a binary companion, profoundly influencing planetary formation and survival. Planets are less common in old binaries, but it is unclear if this reflects inhibited formation, formation of different (smaller) planets, or long-term dynamical destruction. We will age-date planet-hosting binaries using gyrochronology, tracing the evolution of systems across epochs of key dynamical sculpting forces. We will measure rotation periods from TESS FFIs for the >1000 TOIs that have a binary companion, using gyrochronology to sort the ~200 rotationally young binaries into age bins spanning the epoch of dynamical evolution (0-2 Gyr). We thus will track the evolution of planet frequencies, multiplicity, and mass/period distributions.

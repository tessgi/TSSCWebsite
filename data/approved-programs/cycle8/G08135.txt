Title: Tracing Accelerated Electrons Causing Flare Heating

PI: Villadsen, Jackie - Bucknell University

Type: SMALL

Summary: Planets around M dwarfs are prime targets for atmospheric characterization, but stellar flares may undermine their habitability. We propose to characterize these flares using simultaneous optical, radio, and X-ray observations of a young M6 dwarf, UV Ceti. We aim to test the relationship between nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection (radio) and the thermal response of the stellar atmosphere (optical, X-ray). We will characterize flare energy partitions, timing relations, and association rates, probing for departures from the solar flare paradigm in a nearly unexplored data combination with TESS. These novel observations of a fully convective star, compared to early-M and solar data, will illuminate habitability concerns including X-rays and eruptive flares.

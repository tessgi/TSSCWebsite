Title: New Rotation Periods, Ages, And Starspot Cycles For M Dwarfs Within 25 Pc

PI: Kar, Aman - Georgia State University

Type: SMALL

Summary: M dwarf rotation periods have been linked to their activity levels and ages, indicating that rotation is fundamental to M dwarf evolution. We propose to observe 1010 nearby M dwarfs, derived from a comprehensive sample of 3347 M dwarf primaries within 25 pc, that are observable in Cycle 8. This work will triple the number of nearby M dwarfs stars with accurate rotation periods, extend the determinations of these periods beyond TESS s single-sector coverage of 27 days, and explore the long-term stellar spot cycles of the nearest M dwarfs. The pixel-by-pixel analysis in this proposed work allows us to disentangle rotation signals from binary systems or identify contamination from background stars. Of the 1010 stars, 677 will have consecutive observations of at least 54 days.
